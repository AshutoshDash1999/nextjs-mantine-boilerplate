A modern, production-ready boilerplate for building web applications with Next.js 16, React 19, and Mantine UI v8. This template includes everything you need to kickstart your project with best practices, TypeScript, state management, and a beautiful UI component library.

**Perfect for:** Building dashboards, admin panels, SaaS applications, and modern web apps.

## 💡 Why Use This Boilerplate?

### 🎯 Dashboard-First Architecture

Unlike generic Next.js templates, this boilerplate is **specifically designed for dashboard applications**. It includes:

- **Complete AppShell Layout**: Pre-configured dashboard layout with responsive header, sidebar, and mobile drawer navigation
- **Protected Route Structure**: Organized route groups `(auth)` and `(protected)` with proper layout nesting
- **Ready-to-Use Components**: `DashboardHeader` and `DashboardSidebar` components with theme toggle, user menu, and navigation
- **Real-World Examples**: Four complete dashboard pages (Markets, Trending, Favorites, Portfolio) demonstrating production patterns
- **State Management for Dashboards**: Zustand stores with persistence for user preferences (currency, theme, etc.)

### 🚀 Simplified API Integration with react-query-ease

One of the standout features is **react-query-ease**, which dramatically simplifies API calls compared to traditional TanStack Query setups:

**Traditional Approach (Verbose):**

```typescript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["markets", params],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await axios.get("/api/markets", { params });
    return response.data;
  },
});
```

**With react-query-ease (Simple):**

```typescript
const { coins, isLoading } = useMarkets({
  vs_currency: "usd",
  per_page: 20,
});
```

**Key Benefits:**

- ✅ **Zero Boilerplate**: Create API clients with a single configuration
- ✅ **Type-Safe Hooks**: Automatic TypeScript inference with minimal setup
- ✅ **Built-in Caching**: Leverages TanStack Query's powerful caching without manual configuration
- ✅ **Easy to Extend**: Add new endpoints by simply creating new hooks
- ✅ **Perfect for Dashboards**: Ideal for applications that need multiple data sources, pagination, filtering, and real-time updates

### 🛠️ Modern & Production-Ready

- **Latest Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19 with React Compiler, Mantine v8, TypeScript 5
- **Developer Experience**: Biome (faster than ESLint/Prettier), Husky, lint-staged, commitlint
- **Best Practices**: Error boundaries, skeleton loaders, theme system, responsive design
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper type definitions

### 📊 Ideal Use Cases

- **Admin Dashboards**: Analytics, user management, content management
- **SaaS Applications**: Multi-tenant dashboards with data visualization
- **E-commerce Admin Panels**: Product management, order tracking, analytics
- **Financial Dashboards**: Portfolio tracking, market data, reporting
- **Internal Tools**: Company dashboards, reporting tools, data management interfaces

**Bottom Line**: This template saves weeks of setup time by providing a complete, production-ready foundation specifically optimized for dashboard applications, with simplified API integration that makes data fetching as easy as calling a function.

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript

- Always use TypeScript with proper typing
- Avoid using `any` type - use `unknown` or proper types instead
- Use type inference when appropriate, but be explicit for function parameters and return types

#### React Patterns

- Use `"use client"` directive for all interactive components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Prefer named exports for components

#### Mantine v8

- **Always use Mantine v8 patterns** - check [Mantine v8 docs](https://mantine.dev/)
- Use component props for styling when possible
- Follow Mantine's spacing and color systems
- Use responsive props for mobile-first design

#### File Organization

- Co-locate related components in the same directory
- Use `_components/` folders for page-specific components
- Keep shared components in `src/app/_components/` or `src/components/`
- Export components through `index.ts` files

#### State Management

- Use **Zustand** for client-side global state
- Use **TanStack Query** for server state and API calls
- Keep state as local as possible

#### Code Quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Run `npm run format` to auto-format code
- Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
